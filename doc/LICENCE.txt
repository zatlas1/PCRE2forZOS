
PCRE2 LICENCE

------------
PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose
syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5
language.

Release 10.xx of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
licence, as specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in
the "JCLLIB" directory, is distributed under the same terms as the
software itself.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding.
The C++ wrapper that was available in the previous version (PCRE 8.xx)
is not available any more.  The just-in-time compiler that can be used
to optimize pattern matching is not available in z/OS. When available,
these are both optional features that can be omitted when the library
is built.

Please look at the LICENSE file that acompanies the original PCRE2
package.

That original license file is in full effect.  The license file you are
reading now is an addition to the original file in that it adds my name
and copyright for the specific z/OS related code and documentation that
I have written.
