      * While the original UNIX/Windows program now supports the
      *testing of both the 8-bit and 16-bit PCRE libraries in a single
      *program, the z/OS COBOL (and C) versions support only 8 bit
      *EBCDIC.  Modules such as COMPLIE8 (originally pcre_compile.c)
      *in the library itself, are also specifically compiled for 8 bit
      *EBCDIC.  It does, however, make use of SUPPORT_PCRE8 to ensure
      *that it calls only supported library functions.
